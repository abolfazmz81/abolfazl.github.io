                        Welcome to my academic website. I am a Computer Science graduate from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, 
                        where I completed my bachelor's degree in three and a half years. I am currently working as a Research Assistant 
                        at the Artificial Intelligence Research Lab at Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, focusing on software 
                        systems and applications of artificial intelligence.

                        My journey into computer science began with my uncle's influence and my passion for gaming. I was always curious 
                        about how games worked and wanted to create them myself. This curiosity led me to pursue computer science, where 
                        I discovered my true passion for Artificial Intelligence and its transformative potential across various domains, 
                        particularly in healthcare applications.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        I am particularly interested in applying AI techniques to medical diagnostics, including my ongoing research on 
                        machine learning-based diagnosis of Acute Occlusion Myocardial Infarction. I am always open to research 
                        collaborations and exciting opportunities in AI and machine learning.
